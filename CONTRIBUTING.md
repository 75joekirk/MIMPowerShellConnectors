## Contributing to MIMPowerShellConnectors Repo

The two ways to contribute to MIMPowerShellConnectors Repo are: Fork the Repository or Submit an Issue.

### Fork the MIMPowerShellConnectors Repository.

Fork a copy of the [MIMPowerShellConnectors Repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/MIMPowerShellConnectors), make the changes in your fork and send a pull request. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. See [Fork A Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) help article for more information.

#### Coding Guidelines

When developing the code, make sure that you instrument your code extensively and that the code runs with minimum privileges and memory foot-print. Do not hard-code any values, but instead make them configurable via the FIM Sync Engine UI.

##### Code Acceptance

While code acceptance for a bug fix or a minor enhancement is likely to be very straightforward, the code for a new connector will be accepted only if there is consensus among ALL project admins. If there is already a PowerShell connector for similar functionality, you may be asked to join forces and merge your connector with the one that already exists.

### Submit an Issue.

You can also submit an issue. Use the [Issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/MIMPowerShellConnectors/issues) tab to create a new issue.
